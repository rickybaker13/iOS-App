- Design: 2-4 weeks
- Development Setup: 1-2 weeks
- Core Development: 4-8 weeks
- Feature Implementation: 4-8 weeks
- Testing: 2-4 weeks
- Deployment Preparation: 1-2 weeks
- Launch and Post-Launch: Ongoing
- Maintenance and Growth: Ongoing

Note: Timeline estimates are approximate and may vary based on project complexity, team size, and specific requirements.

## Progress Summary

### Completed (May 3, 2024)
- âœ… Project setup and initialization
- âœ… Basic app structure creation
- âœ… Data models implementation (Subject, Subcategory, Lecture)
- âœ… Home screen UI implementation
- âœ… Recording screen UI implementation
- âœ… Subject and subcategory management UI
- âœ… Basic audio recording setup

### Current Status
- ðŸš§ Implementing audio recording functionality
  - Added microphone permissions
  - Set up audio session
  - Implemented recording controls
  - Added error handling
  - Next steps:
    1. Test recording functionality
    2. Add data persistence for recordings
    3. Implement playback functionality

### Next Steps
1. Test and debug audio recording
2. Implement data persistence
3. Add playback functionality
4. Implement transcription service
5. Add AI integration for note generation

Note: Development paused during audio recording implementation. To continue, focus on testing and completing the recording functionality.
